# üè¶ Banking Customer Churn 

In this project, we aim to conduct an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis of the Banking Customer dataset. Additionally, we will develop machine learning models to predict the likelihood of customer churn for future use.


## üóÇÔ∏è Content

- Customer-Churn-Records.csv: This CSV file contains the banking customer dataset, including the target variable indicating churn or non-churn.
- Banking_Customer.ipynb: In this Python file, you'll find the implementation of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and various machine learning models.
- analytics.sql: The SQL file contains queries for customer retention analysis, providing additional insights into the dataset.
## üìù Documentation

- As a preliminary step, we will engage in data cleaning and manipulation. This involves renaming certain columns, eliminating unnecessary ones, and introducing new columns to enhance the overall dataset.
- Subsequently, we will perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify the variables that exhibit the most substantial correlation with the target variable (Exited).
- Following the EDA, we will proceed to build multiple machine learning models to determine the most effective one in terms of accuracy. Additionally, we will employ cross-validation to assess each model's performance on new and unseen data.
- Lastly, we will draw conclusions from the project, highlighting insights gained, evaluating model performance, providing recommendations, and outlining potential future steps.
